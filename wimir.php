  <h2>Women in Music Information Retrieval (WiMIR)</h2>

  <p>WiMIR is a group of people dedicated to promoting the role of, and
  increasing opportunities for, women in the MIR field. We meet to socialize,
  share information, and discuss in an informal setting, with the goal of building
  a community around women in our field.</p>

  <p>WiMR has held an annual meeting at the ISMIR conference since 2012. The
  meetings have had a high turnout of both female and male attendees. A number
  of important issues ranging from mentorship, conference support, to improving
  the representativeness of women researchers in the community were discussed. Photos
  from the WiMIR meeting at ISMIR 2014 can be
